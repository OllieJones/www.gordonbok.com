<h3>Gordon Bok and Bob Zentz - Together Again For the First Time</h3>
            
<p><i>"In late March 1979, Gordon and I were on an odyssey of exploration, friendship, teaching, and learning.  We tried to create a blueprint of the mystical 'business' called 'music', but in reality, you can't distill what we do down to a formula... it's more like alchemy of old, lost to time but alive in our imagining.<br><br>

Two old friends are now privileged to revisit it again in our later years.  As the saying goes, you had to be there... but if you weren't, you can be now."<br>

<h2><strong>Carol's Corner:</strong></h2>

	

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp; I was interviewed recently about my stroke for the Brain Injury Association of Maine newsletter. They have collected stories from Maine survivors. I am proud to be included among these remarkable stories of will, perseverance and hope as we have all moved on and gone on to re-invent ourselves as we learn there is life after stroke. My story is #18 in the list but they are continually adding more stories.<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp; March is Brain Injury Awareness Month.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="https://www.biausa.org/Maine/Our-Stories" target="new">https://www.biausa.org/find-bia/states/news/2015-maine-survivor-stories-archive</a></p>
<i>Note:  Carol was interviewed in 2017; her story is now listed in the archives of the BIA website.</i>
