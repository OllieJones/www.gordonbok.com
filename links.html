<h3>Margaret MacArthur</h3>
              
<P><i>&quot;Margaret plays harp and mountain dulcimer.  She collects songs, no matter where she goes.  She is a loving and loved human being.  Since I have been in the United States I have not met a finer song collector with a surer ear for all that is pithy and true in the songs of her country.&quot;</i></P>

When Margaret wasn't on the road performing, she was mass producing her phenomenal home made bread, working in her beautiful gardens and living the simple life.</P>
              
<P>Margaret died in May, 2006.  Gordon had the honor of singing with her in the last concert she performed.</P>

In 2000, they performed their Farewell Tour, dropping anchor on the traveling part of their musical collaboration, which they describe as "a wonderful mixture of art, friendship and indulgence." Along with their own solo albums, they have recorded eleven albums together. We have them all and each one a jewel.</p>
